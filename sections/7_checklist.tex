\section*{Checklist}

%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist follows the references.  Please
read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
\answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
\end{itemize}
Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{We accent on the novelty of method developed and its potential to generalize the orientation recovery in SPA, as well as that it is not yet the state-of-the-art.}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{See Section \ref{sec:discussion}.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerTODO{Don't think we have any?}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerTODO{Not yet available https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/EthicsReview}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{We include the link to the code that includes data, notebooks and website with instructions to reproduce the results.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{See \apxref{optimization-settings} with hyperparameters, see Section \ref{sec:results:data} and Table \ref{tab:dataset} for the data split and the reason it was chosen.}
	\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerTODO{The error bar plots we have are distribution over epochs, see \figref{results:distance-estimation} and \figref{4d-vs-256d-de}.}
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{See \apxref{optimization-settings}.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
    \answerYes{We used proteins from publicly available RCSB Protein Data Bank. We cited every used protein, see Section  \ref{sec:results:data}. We also used and cited ASTRA toolbox in the same section.}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets?
    \answerNo{There is no licence on the data used, see https://www.rcsb.org/pages/policies.}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerYes{URL to the code and models in the Abstract.}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?

\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{}
