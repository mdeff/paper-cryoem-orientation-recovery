\section*{Checklist}

%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references.  Please
% read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
% questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
% \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
% Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{See \secref{discussion}.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerYes{We didn't identify any potential risk for improving protein imaging. Moreover, our work only addresses a small step in a huge pipeline. However, we mention the environmental impact from training the model (see \secref{discussion}) by estimating the energy consumption and carbon footprint. The hardware specification and training times can be found \apxref{optimization-settings}.}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{We include a URL in the Abstract to a git repository that includes code, data, and instructions to reproduce our results. Moreover, notebooks and an interactive website are provided to further play with the method.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{See \secref{results:data} (including \tabref{dataset}) for the preparation of data and how they were split. See \apxref{optimization-settings} for the hyperparameters.}
  \item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
%    \answerNo{Our results are mostly qualitative and were robust to re-running. We aren't trying to beat the state-of-the-art on a standardized benchmark.}
    \answerYes{When there was variance, e.g., on \figref{results:distance-estimation} and \figref{4d-vs-256d-de}.}
%    \answerTODO{The error bar plots we have are distribution over epochs, see \figref{results:distance-estimation} and \figref{4d-vs-256d-de}.}
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{See \apxref{optimization-settings}.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
    \answerYes{We used proteins from the publicly available Protein Data Bank (PDB) and cited the ones we used, see \secref{results:data}. We also used and cited the ASTRA toolbox in the same section.}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets?
    \answerYes{The license of our code is mentioned in the \texttt{README.md} and included in a \texttt{LICENSE.txt} file in our git repository. PDB data are free of all copyright restrictions and made fully and freely available for both non-commercial and commercial use.}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerYes{As a URL in the Abstract.}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
    \answerNA{Our data are proteins.}
  \item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
    \answerNA{Our data are proteins.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
