\section{Experiments}

%\lau{Move this paragraph somewhere.} 
To evaluate our method, we started with the orientation recovery experiments that included tests of feasibility and sensitivity to distance estimation error. 
We then learned the distance using a SiameseNN and compared its performance with the baseline. 
%After developing and tuning the architecture of the network for the distance estimation, we continue by introducing the perturbation to the projections.  and the network architecture is adjusted
The robustness of the network to perturbations is then evaluated.
Finally, we ran the whole machine learning pipeline to recover the orientations from estimated distances.

\subsection{Experimental conditions}\label{sec:results:data}

%\paragraph{Proteins.}
%\lau{Put pas tense everywhere.} 
We considered two proteins (\figref{pdb-proteins}): the $\beta$-galactosidase, a protein with a dihedral (D2) symmetry, and the lambda excision HJ intermediate (HJI), an asymmetric protein with local cyclic (C1) symmetry. 
Their deposited PDB atomic models are \texttt{5a1a}~\cite{bartesaghi2015betagal} and \texttt{5j0n}~\cite{laxmikanthan2016structure}, respectively.
For each atomic model, we generated the ground truth by fitting a 5\AA\ density map in Chimera~\cite{pettersen2004ucsf}, which gave us a volume of $110 \times 155 \times 199$ voxels for the $\beta$-galactosidase, and a volume of $69 \times 57 \times 75$ voxels for the HJI.

        \textbf{(b)} lambda excision HJ intermediate (HJI) (\texttt{5j0n})~\cite{5j0n_pdb}.
    }\label{fig:pdb-proteins}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Projections.}
From these ground truths, we generated $5,000$ synthetic projections of size $275\times 275$ and $116\times 116$, respectively, using the ASTRA projector~\cite{van2015astra}.
Our projection generator supports two orientation samplings: (i) sampling the Euler angles $\bth=(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ uniformly, and (ii) sampling uniformly on $\SO(3)$.
Due to protein symmetries, orientations were sampled differently.
The entire \texttt{5j0n} complex being asymmetric~\cite{doi:10.1002/9780470514160.ch4} makes it sufficient to sample the \textit{half} of the $\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere, since the other half will have equivalent projections that are symmetric to the center of this sphere.
Conversely, the $\beta$-galactosidase has D2 symmetry, i.e., it is composed of four identical sub-units with two rotations of magnitude $\pi$ rad around the first axis followed by $\pi$ rad rotation around second axis, as illustrated and explained in~\cite{symmetry_in_protein,symmetry,scipion-em-github, rcsb-symmetry-view, EmpereurMot2019GeometricDO}.
Therefore, we restricted the sampling to the quarter of $\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere for this protein.
%\mdeff{We should explain why.}
\figref{different-projections} shows example projections.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Perturbations.}
We considered the following perturbations to control the difficulty of orientation recovery: (i) additive white noise, (ii) translations, (iii) inclusion of the effects of the point-spread functions (PSF). 
The mathematical formulation of these three components is given in \eqnref{imaging-model}.

    }\label{tab:dataset}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Distance learning.}
We used the supervised learning where the input are pairs of images and the output is their respective quaternion distance calculated from the ground truth orientations.
For the training, dataset was split into a distinct training, validation, and testing set (see \tabref{dataset}).
The total number of generated projections was $P = 5,000$.
Therefore, the number of possible projection pairs was $P^2 = 25e6$.
Splitting $P^2$ into the training, validation, and testing sets would mean that some of the projections appearing in pairs in the training dataset can appear in pairs in the other datasets.
To ensure that the results generalize to unseen data, we split the projections $P$ (and not $P^2$) into training, validation, and testing projection sets.
With these three projections sets we create disjoint projection pair datasets sets (column with $P^2$ values in \tabref{dataset}).
In addition to this, we use only $1\%$ of the possible pairs (last column in the \tabref{dataset}) due to limitation of available resources for the training.
%\todo{Better explain why projections (and not pairs) must be separated in the various sets.}


\paragraph{Orientation recovery.}
Orientations were recovered through \eqnref{orientation-recovery} in a stochastic setting, with the loss function varying over the batches.
To ensure unbiased model, the dataset used in this part was test set from \tabref{dataset}.
Orientation recovery was performed on projections unseen during distance learning.
Since mean orientation error is used in the pose estimation tasks and it is considered reliable performance metric, we decided to use it as our performance measure (see Appendix~\ref{apx:metrics-review}). The average difference between predicted and actual angles is degree (or rad), which makes it an intuitive comparison metric. 
We employ the definition of a correct estimation: the estimation must be within 10\degree~(0.174 rad) of true orientations for noiseless data and within 25\degree~(0.436 rad) for noisy data.
\figref{5j0n-aa-loss-perfect-distances} shows a successful convergence and mean orientation recovery error before and after alignment with the perfect distance $d_q$.

%\subsubsection{Robustness of Recovery to Additive Errors on the Relative Distances}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Sensitivity of orientation recovery to errors in distance estimation}\label{sec:results:orientation-recovery:sensitivity}

%\mdeff{Story: (i) orientation recovery error is strongly linked to distance estimation error, (ii) recovery loss is a good proxy of mean recovery error.}

To prove that orientation recovery is feasible, we first evaluate the performance assuming we have ideal distance metric between two projections, i.e., the quaternion distance between their corresponding orientations. 
The method successfully recovers the orientation of every projection, see Appendix~\ref{apx:results:orientation-recovery:exact}.

We now go one step further and evaluate the behaviour of~\eqnref{orientation-recovery} when the true relative distances are corrupted by additive Gaussian noise.
The experimental conditions are the same as in the previous section, except that we add an error with increasing variance on the relative distances prior to the minimization. Precisely: $d_p = d_q + n$ with $n$ sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variances in $[0.0, 0.8]$.
The results are presented in \figref{perfect-with-noise-ar-aa} (red curve).
For all variances, the mean orientation recovery error $E$ is reported in \figref{perfect-with-noise-ar-aa} (blue curve).

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{
        The mean orientation recovery error $E$ from \eqnref{orientation-recovery-error} is a monotonic function of the distance estimation error.
        Better distance estimation leads to better orientation recovery.
        Moreover, the recovery loss \eqnref{orientation-recovery} is a good proxy for the recovery error $E$, allowing us to assess recovery performance even without ground-truth orientations.
}
    \label{fig:perfect-with-noise-ar-aa}
\end{figure}

These results demonstrate that the performance of orientation recovery~\eqnref{orientation-recovery} depends on the quality of the estimated distances, which advocates for a proper and extensive training of the SiameseNN in the next stages of development.
Another interesting output of \figref{perfect-with-noise-ar-aa} is that it indicates that the error of the orientation recovery behaves as a monotonic function of its loss.
Hence, it suggests that the loss can be used as a good indicator of its performance, which has obvious practical implications for our future works on real data.

\subsection{Learned function for relative distance estimation }\label{sec:results:distance-estimation:learned}

%\mdeff{Story: learned distance $d_{ps}$ estimates $d_q$ with some variance but still underestimates larger distances.
%Again symmetric vs asymmetric.}

We present here a preliminary evaluation of the ability of SiameseNNs to learn a projection distance $\widehat{d_p}$ that correctly approximates the orientation distance $d_q$. 
To assess the progress and effectiveness of our distance estimation implementation, we used an Euclidean distance as a baseline (see Appendix~\ref{apx:results:distance-estimation}).

%SiameseNNs come with a variety of more or less powerful architectures.
%At the current stage of development, we work with a simple one.
%Our SiameseNN is composed of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with shared weights.
%Their output features vectors are compared through an Eulidean distance, \textit{i.e.}, $d_f(\mathbf{f}_i,\mathbf{f}_j)=\lVert \mathbf{f}_i-\mathbf{f_j}\rVert_2$ in \figref{schematic:distance-learning}.
%Besides the Euclidean distance, this distance metric $F$ can be defined as geodesic distance, or it could be parametrized as MLP, used for a general function approximation, which we will explore in some of the following experiments.
%\mdeff{Don't repeat what's written in \secref{method:distance-learning}. The general stuff goes there, the specific here.}

%\mdeff{What is $d_f$ in this particular experiment? Euclidean? Cosine=$d_q$?}
For each protein, we trained the SiameseNN on its training dataset for 150 epochs ($\sim$2.6 hours) using an RMSProp optimizer~\cite{tieleman2012rmsprop}, a learning rate of $10^{-3}$, and a batch size of 256 pairs. 
As a feature distance $d_f$ between the outputs of the two CNNs we used the Geodesic distance \eqnref{geodesic-distance}.
The pairs for the training were sampled from $1\%$ of maximum number of training pairs $P_{\text{train}}^2$ ($63,126$ pairs) and validation was performed on $1\%$ of the maximum number of validation pairs $P_{\text{val}}^2$ ($27,225$ pairs). 
We limited our training and validation dataset due to Google Colaboratory~\footnote{A hosted Jupyter notebook service from Google Research with resources that are not guaranteed and not unlimited.} training time limit of 12 hours.

%\mdeff{So those pairs are sampled from $63,126$ pairs from the training dataset, rather than the $P^2$ possible pairs? If true, we should motivate somewhere why we limit our training dataset.}
Depending on the available resources on the Google Colaboratory, the training lasted from 2.6 hours to 9.3 hours on one of its GPUs.
The evolution of the training and validation losses are presented on the left side in \figref{losses-siamese-assym} for the asymmetric protein (\texttt{5j0n}), and on the left side in \figref{losses-siamese-sym} for the symmetric one (\texttt{5a1a}).
The results demonstrate that the SiameseNN succeeded at learning a proxy distance for the asymmetric protein dataset, as convergence was reached in about 50 epochs ($\sim$ 50 minutes in the best resource availability setting).

%\todo{Mention the plateau phenomenon, similarly to Euclidean $d_p$.}
Similarly to Euclidean distance $d_p$, we noticed that the larger distances $d_q$ were poorly predicted and the plot again had a slight plateau phenomenon for the distances higher than ~$2.5$ rad.

It is interesting to see that both validation losses were around $0.2$.
However, the current SiameseNN architecture slightly overfits at learning the distance for the dataset \texttt{5a1a}, which is very likely due to the symmetry of the $\beta$-galactosidase protein, even thought the quarter-sphere coverage was used.
%Indeed, its synthetic dataset may still contain pairs of projections that share the same $d_p$, yet differ in their $d_q$.
This simply advocates for the restriction to non-overlapping areas on $\SO(3)$ when sampling the orientations used to generate the SiameseNN training dataset.
The latter would then only contain projection pairs with a linear $(d_q,d_p)$ relationship, which should ensure a successful training of the network.
%\mdeff{I don't get this explanation. Do you mean that \texttt{5a1a} might have other symmetries than D2?}
For the rest of the experiments, we used the asymmetric protein (\texttt{5j0n}) dataset.
Besides using the asymmetric protein, we performed the full protein reconstruction pipeline on the symmetric protein (\texttt{5a1a}).

We then fed to the trained SiameseNN $1,000$ pairs of projections randomly selected from the \texttt{5j0n} testing dataset, and reported the $(d_q,\widehat{d_p})$ relationship of each pair in \figref{losses-siamese} (right side of each subfigure).
These results confirm that, the SiameseNN was able to predict the orientation distance $d_q$ using only the projections as inputs. 
The prediction performance was slightly better for the asymmetric protein compared to symmetric protein.
Moreover, it clearly outperformed the Euclidean distance at doing so.
These preliminary results are encouraging, as much has yet to be gained from improving upon the rather primitive SiameseNN architecture we currently use. 
The architecture of implemented SiameseNN can be seen in Appendix~\ref{sec:siamese-architecture}. 
Besides concentrating on the hyperparameter selection and tuning of the neural network layers, we also evaluated the performance of the model depending on the feature distance we used for the SiameseNN, see\figref{geo-eucl-mlp} and Appendix~\ref{apx:de-influence-arch}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Sensitivity of learned distance to perturbations in the projections}\label{sec:results:distance-estimation:sensitivity}

%\mdeff{Story: learned distance is minimally sensible to perturbations (additive noise, translation, PSF) because we can train it to ignore irrelevant information.
%Thanks again to good model of cryo-EM imaging.}
%\mdeff{Better word? (perturbations, quality, non-ideal)}

In this experiment we wanted to explore how does the perturbation of the projections affect the distance estimation (additive noise, translation, PSF). 
The experimental conditions for the experiment were the same as before, except that we added noise with increasing variance on the projection prior to training.
The results are presented in \figref{distance-estimation-vary-projection-noise}.

We observe that the training and validation losses were increasing and network started to overfit w.r.t.\ the amount of noise in the projections.
With the noiseless projections (projection noise variance 0), the mean orientation recovery error $E = 0.1594$ rad.
Whereas, the noisy projections with noise levels 15 were the closest to the realistic protein projections and the error $E=0.4189$ rad.
The SiameseNN was able to learn the noise as the training loss and corresponding mean orientation recovery error $E$ stayed low.
%\mdeff{The SiameseNN seems to be able to learn the noise, as the training loss stays low. More data should help!}

Besides testing the performance of the pipeline with the noisy projections, we explored the performance with different projection translation levels.
To translate the projection, we used a triangular distribution from $-t$ to $t$ px translation with the peak in the center of the projection.
The performance of different translation magnitudes can be seen in \figref{distance-estimation-vary-projection-translation}.
We observe that the training of the network was invariant to translations in the projections, which was expected.
We can see that the learned distance was minimally sensible to perturbations because we trained the network to ignore irrelevant information.

\subsection{Orientation recovery from estimated distances}

%\mdeff{Story: pipeline works but better distance estimation is needed for SOTA reconstruction.
%Method is however promising because learned distance is robust to perturbations and recovery works if distance works.}
%\todo{Justify threshold because of plateau (figref).
%Show recovered orientations w.r.t.\ ground truth after alignment.}
%\todo{Reconstruct the protein to show the full pipeline: from a set of projections to a reconstructed protein.
%Emphasize that it's a naive reconstruction algorithm.}

The orientation recovery from estimated distances represents a full pipeline needed to reconstruct the protein from a given set of projections.
We ran the pipeline for both, asymmetric (\texttt{5j0n}) and symmetric (\texttt{5a1a}) protein.
In addition, we ran the pipeline for the simulated realistic noise in the asymmetric protein.
The experimental setting for distance estimation was similar to the one used to generate the \figref{learned-distance-siamese}: 150 epochs, 1e-3 learning rate, batch size 256 with random sampling of the projections, but for feature distance metric we used the geodesic distance since it showed the best performance in \figref{geo-eucl-mlp}.

We then ran the orientation recovery on the estimated distances of the asymmetric protein and the performance results can be observed in \figref{5j0n-orientation-recovery-loss-est} with the same experimental setting as in \figref{5j0n-orientation-recovery-loss}.
With the noiseless projections, the objective function successfully converged to the $0.0510$ and with the noisy projections, the objective function converged to the $0.0683$.

As a last step of the pipeline, we performed protein reconstruction using the projections and their corresponding estimated orientations.
Using the ASTRA toolbox, we generated orientation vectors based on angles which we fed into projection 3D geometry in ASTRA.
With total of $1,650$ projections in the test dataset, we were able to reconstruct the protein.

Similarly, we ran the whole reconstruction pipeline on the symmetric protein (\texttt{5a1a}).
The experimental conditions for the distance estimation were the same as for the asymmetric protein, except that we used the quarter-sphere projections coverage (whereas, in the asymmetric protein we used half-sphere coverage).
The orientation recovery loss is shown in \figref{5a1a-orientation-recovery-loss}. 
It successfully converged to $0.0381$.
The mean orientation recovery error for symmetric protein \texttt{5a1a} is shown in \figref{angle-alignment-5a1a-noise0}. 
The smallest error achieved was $0.1871$ rad.

Lastly, we performed the protein reconstruction with the same ASTRA toolbox setting as for the asymmetric protein. 
The results of the reconstruction are shown in \figref{5a1a-reconstruction-noise0}.
We successfully reconstructed the symmetric protein even though the distance estimation was noisier than the one performed on the asymmetric protein.

We observe that the pipeline works, but for the state-of-the-art reconstruction we need a better distance estimation.
However, the method developed is promising since the learned distance is robust to perturbations.
We observe that the orientation recovery and distance estimation are interconnected, \textit{i.e.} if one works the other one will work.

To check the generalization to unseen proteins, and not only to  unseen projections, we trained the distance estimation on the set of four different proteins (\texttt{5nvu}~\cite{5nvu_pdb}, \texttt{5nvs}~\cite{5nvs_pdb}, \texttt{6mem}~\cite{6mem_pdb}, \texttt{6o1o}~\cite{6o1o_pdb}) that have the same type of symmetry (asymmetric  C1) as the one protein (\texttt{5j0n}) in the test dataset that is used in orientation recovery.
The orientation recovery reached the error of 0.0352.
This proves that distance learning was able to abstract the protein and that way generalized the distance metric to the unseen proteins.
