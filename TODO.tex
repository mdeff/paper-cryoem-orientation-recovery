\todo{\paragraph{Overall TODOs.}\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $\mathbf{p}$ to denote projections everywhere (also double-check figures, plot axes, legends, etc.).
    \item Index all objects using subscripts. Report all results in radians. Use sentence case. Use American english.
    \item Laur√®ne is in charge of the Abstract, Introduction and Section 2.
    \item Jelena is in charge of Section 3, including the task of adding and describing the latest results.
\end{itemize}}

\todo{\paragraph{STILL TO DISCUSS.}\begin{itemize}
    \item Bold face for vectors and matrices? \mdeff{That's quite signal processing. Is the cryo-EM community using this convention?} \lau{They do as well.}
    
    \item  Orientations: Use $q$ or $\boldsymbol\theta$ for the orientation, and $\mathbf{R}$ for rotation. To be settle after writing \secref{method:orientation-representation}.  
    
    \item distance functions: orientations SO(3) geodesic $d_o$, projections Euclidean $d_{pe}$, projections learned $d_{pl}$. \lau{Let's settle on that.}
     
    \item Consistency: convergence curves must all have the same x-axis (time, step, or epoch). \mdeff{I think epoch would be good.}
    
    \item SO(3) half coverage (it is $S^2$ half coverage)
    
\end{itemize}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\todo{\paragraph{TO KEEP IN MIND.}\begin{itemize}
    \item phrases to keep all along: distance estimation (verb: estimate distances), distance learning (verb: learn distance), orientation recovery (verb: recover orientations)
    \item Typography: \mdeff{footnotes after periods, em dashes, Oxford comma, commas after i.e.\ and e.g., (i) and (ii). Again no strong feeling, most important is consistency.}
    \item Give meaningful and consistent names to figures. To avoid confusion, label = figure name.
\end{itemize}}
