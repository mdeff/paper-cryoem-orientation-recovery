\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We present a method for the recovery of orientations from \todo{cryo-EM/single-particle projections/imaging, towards the goal of protein reconstruction}. \mdeff{@Laurène: write the standard bioimaging formulation of this problem.}
    \todo{method builds on / intuition}
    Our method is made of two steps: (i) estimate distances between projections, and (ii) recover orientations from these distances.
    % absolute orientations vs relative distances?
    The pairwise distance estimator is a Siamese Neural Network trained on synthetic projections of known protein \todo{reconstructions/structures/conformations}.
    Orientations are recovered by minimizing an objective function.
    Experimental results show that the quality of the recovered orientations strongly depends on the quality of the estimated distances.
    While not yet up to state-of-the art protein reconstruction, distance estimation is robust to perturbations.
    Overall, recovered orientations from \todo{(noisy?)} projections are within \todo{10\degree} of true orientations.
    Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/JelenaBanjac/protein-reconstruction}.

\todo{\paragraph{Overall TODOs.}\begin{itemize}
    \item projection: $\mathbf{p}$ or $\mathbf{b}$? \mdeff{I'd prefer $\mathbf{p}$ if there's no conflict anymore. Please choose and update everywhere.}
    \item orientations: $o$? \mdeff{$q$ stands for quaternion, but that's an implementation detail. The semantic meaning is an orientation. Similarly, we shouldn't use $R$ for rotation.}
    \item \mdeff{Can we index all objects, projections and orientations, with either subscripts or superscripts? I don't really care which (but prefer subscripts) as long as it's consistent. Please choose and update everywhere.}
    \item distance functions: orientations SO(3) geodesic $d_o$, projections Euclidean $d_{pe}$, projections learned $d_{pl}$
        \mdeff{Alternative: $d$ for true distance, $\widehat{d}$ for estimations. But how to differentiate the two kinds of estimations?}
    \item report all results in radians or degrees? \mdeff{I guess we should use what the cryo-EM / SPA community uses.}
    \item phrases to keep all along: distance estimation (verb: estimate distances), distance learning (verb: learn distance), orientation recovery (verb: recover orientations)
    \item Title or sentence case? \mdeff{I prefer sentence case because it's more natural. No need for title case to seem serious. But I'm ok either way. Most important is consistency.}
    \item Typography: \mdeff{footnotes after periods, em dashes, Oxford comma, commas after i.e.\ and e.g., (i) and (ii). Again no strong feeling, most important is consistency.}
    \item Settle on American or British English. \mdeff{I have a tendency for American.}
    \item Give meaningful and consistent names to figures. To avoid confusion, label = figure name.
    \item Consistency: loss or objective (in text and figures).
    \item Consistency: convergence curves must all have the same x-axis (time, step, or epoch). \mdeff{I think epoch would be good.}
    \item Acronyms: be sure to introduce them then use consistently.
