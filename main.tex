\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    A major challenge in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is that the orientations adopted by the 3D particles prior to imaging are unknown; yet, their knowledge is essential for high-resolution reconstruction.
    We present a method to recover these orientations directly from the acquired set of 2D projections. 
    Our approach consists of two steps: (i) the estimation of the relative distances between numerous pairs of projections, and (ii) the recovery of the absolute orientation of each projection from these distances.
    % absolute orientations vs relative distances?
    For step (i), the pairwise distance estimator is a Siamese neural network trained on synthetic cryo-EM projections from resolved bio-structures.
    For step (ii), the orientations are recovered by minimizing an appropriate loss function using gradient based optimization.
    Evaluating our method on the synthetic data indicated high agreement with the ground truth orientations even with a realistic level of perturbations in the projections.
    %Experimental results show that \lau{put here the latest results situation. %the quality of the recovered orientations strongly depends on the quality of the estimated distances.
    %While not yet up to state-of-the art ..., distance estimation is robust to perturbations (adapt).}
    \banjac{Not the state of the art, but we present the roadmap and preliminary results.}
    The preliminary results , the orientations recovered from non-perturbed projections are withing $10\degree$, and from perturbed projections are within $24\degree$ of the true orientations.
    Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/JelenaBanjac/protein-reconstruction}.
