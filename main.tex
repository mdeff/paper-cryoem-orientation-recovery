\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    A major challenge in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is that the orientations adopted by the 3D particles prior to imaging are random and thus unknown; yet, their knowledge is essential for the high-resolution reconstruction of bio-structures. In this work, we present a method to recover these orientations directly from the acquired set of 2D projections. Our approach consists of two steps: (i) the estimation of the relative distances between numerous pairs of projections, and (ii) the recovery of the absolute orientation of each projection from these distances.
    % absolute orientations vs relative distances?
    For step (i), the pairwise distance estimator is a Siamese Neural Network trained on synthetic cryo-EM projections of resolved bio-structures.
    For step (ii), the orientations are recovered by minimizing an objective function.
    Experimental results show that \lau{put here the latest results situation.} %the quality of the recovered orientations strongly depends on the quality of the estimated distances.
    While not yet up to state-of-the art protein reconstruction, distance estimation is robust to perturbations.
    Overall, the orientations recovered from the \todo{(noisy?)} projections are within \todo{10\degree} of the true orientations.
    Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/JelenaBanjac/protein-reconstruction}.

\todo{\paragraph{Overall TODOs.}\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $\mathbf{p}$ to denote projections everywhere (also double-check figures, plot axes, legends, etc.).
    \item Index all objects using subscripts. Report all results in radians. Use sentence case. Use American english. 
    \item Laurène is in charge of the Abstract, Introduction and Section 2. 
    \item Jelena is in charge of Section 3, including the task of adding and describing the latest results. 
\end{itemize}}

\todo{\paragraph{STILL TO DISCUSS.}\begin{itemize}
    \item  orientations: $o$? \mdeff{$q$ stands for quaternion, but that's an implementation detail. The semantic meaning is an orientation. Similarly, we shouldn't use $R$ for rotation.} \lau{No one really uses the notation $o$ in the field; most people use $\boldsymbol\theta$, usually to refer to Euler angles. We could use that notation as well, precising it's for quaternions. Or use $q$. Both are fine for me. Regarding rotation: most people do use the notation $R$ in the field, but I'm flexible on this. To recap, my preferences: Use $q$ or $\boldsymbol\theta$ for the orientation, and $\mathbf{R}$ for rotation. What about you?}
    \item distance functions: orientations SO(3) geodesic $d_o$, projections Euclidean $d_{pe}$, projections learned $d_{pl}$ \mdeff{Alternative: $d$ for true distance, $\widehat{d}$ for estimations. But how to differentiate the two kinds of estimations?} \lau{I was personnally thinking of using $d_q$ for  the geodesic distance, $d_p$ for a distance between projections (with the context making clear which one we are using), and $\widehat{d}_p$ when the latter distance is learned/estimated. Would that be a problem in term of notations?}
    \item Consistency: convergence curves must all have the same x-axis (time, step, or epoch). \mdeff{I think epoch would be good.} \lau{@Jelena: Ok for you to put everything with epoch?}
    \item Consistency: loss or objective (in text and figures). \lau{@Mdeff: You're suggesting to pick one and stick to it, right?}
\end{itemize}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\todo{\paragraph{TO KEEP IN MIND.}\begin{itemize}
    \item phrases to keep all along: distance estimation (verb: estimate distances), distance learning (verb: learn distance), orientation recovery (verb: recover orientations)
    \item Typography: \mdeff{footnotes after periods, em dashes, Oxford comma, commas after i.e.\ and e.g., (i) and (ii). Again no strong feeling, most important is consistency.}
    \item Give meaningful and consistent names to figures. To avoid confusion, label = figure name.
    \item Acronyms: be sure to introduce them then use consistently. \lau{A note on that: I strongly suggest we use single-particle cryo-EM and not SPA when referring to the imaging modality. The latter is less used.}
