\begin{abstract}
    A major challenge in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is that the orientations adopted by the 3D particles prior to imaging are unknown; yet, this knowledge is essential for high-resolution reconstruction.
    We present a method to recover these orientations directly from the acquired set of 2D projections.
    Our approach consists of two steps: (i) the estimation of the relative distances between pairs of projections, and (ii) the recovery of the absolute orientation of each projection from these distances.
    In step (i), pairwise distances are estimated by a Siamese neural network trained on synthetic cryo-EM projections from resolved bio-structures.
    In step (ii), orientations are recovered by minimizing the difference between (a) the distances estimated from the projections and (b) the distances induced by the recovered orientations.

    Evaluations on synthetic data indicates accurate recovery of the orientations, even with a realistic level of perturbations in the projections.
    While not yet up to state-of-the-art methods, we present the road map and preliminary results of a novel method that promises robustness to perturbation in the projections as well as the quality of the recovered orientations that strongly depends on the quality of estimated distances.
    %The preliminary results , the orientations recovered from non-perturbed projections are within $10\degree$, and from perturbed projections are within $24\degree$ of the true orientations.
