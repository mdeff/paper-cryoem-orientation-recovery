\begin{abstract}
    We present a method for the recovery of orientations from \todo{Cryo-EM/single-particle projections/imaging, towards the goal of protein reconstruction}. \mdeff{@Laurène: write the standard bio formulation of this problem.}
    Our method is made of two steps: (i) estimate distances between projections, and (ii) estimate orientations from these distances.
    % absolute orientations vs relative distances?
    The pairwise distance estimator is a Siamese Neural Network trained on synthetic projections of known protein \todo{reconstructions/structures/conformations}.
    Orientations are estimated by minimizing an objective function.
    Experimental results show that the quality of the estimated orientations strongly depends on the quality of the estimated distances.
    While not yet up to state-of-the art protein reconstruction, distance estimation is robust to \todo{noisy projections}.
    Overall, estimated orientations from \todo{(noisy?)} projections are within \todo{10\degree} of true orientations.
    Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/JelenaBanjac/protein-reconstruction}.
