	abstract = {3D rotations arise in many computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics problems and evaluation of the distance between two 3D rotations is often an essential task. This paper presents a detailed analysis of six functions for measuring distance between 3D rotations that have been proposed in the literature. Based on the well-developed theory behind 3D rotations, we demonstrate that five of them are bi-invariant metrics on SO(3) but that only four of them are boundedly equivalent to each other. We conclude that it is both spatially and computationally more efficient to use quaternions for 3D rotations. Lastly, by treating the two rotations as a true and an estimated rotation matrix, we illustrate the geometry associated with iso-error measures.},

    abstract="The specification of the information on the three-dimensional orientation of an image with respect to a given coordinate system is at the heart of our ability to reconstruct a three-dimensional object from sets of its two-dimensional projection images. Transferring this information from one package to another is important to structural biologists wanting to get the best from each software suite. In this chapter, we review in depth the main considerations and implications associated with the unambiguous specification of geometrical specifications, in this way paving the way to the future specifications of standards in the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy. This is the case of EMX in which affine transformations have been adopted as the means to communicate geometrical information.",

abstract = {Summary
Cytoplasmic dynein-1 binds dynactin and cargo adaptor proteins to form a transport machine capable of long-distance processive movement along microtubules. However, it is unclear why dynein-1 moves poorly on its own or how it is activated by dynactin. Here, we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the complete 1.4-megadalton human dynein-1 complex in an inhibited state known as the phi-particle. We reveal the 3D structure of the cargo binding dynein tail and show how self-dimerization of the motor domains locks them in a conformation with low microtubule affinity. Disrupting motor dimerization with structure-based mutagenesis drives dynein-1 into an open form with higher affinity for both microtubules and dynactin. We find the open form is also inhibited for movement and that dynactin relieves this by reorienting the motor domains to interact correctly with microtubules. Our model explains how dynactin binding to the dynein-1 tail directly stimulates its motor activity.}

Though the asymmetrical nature of amino acids plays the central role in determining the asymmetrical aspects of protein structures, it has little or no influence on the next level of biological structures-assemblies of protein molecules.}

    abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available  dataset  of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual  competition  and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008---2012. The paper is intended for two audiences:  algorithm designers , researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and,  challenge designers , who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012 ) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

Evaluation of 6D object pose estimates is not straightforward. Object pose may be ambiguous due to object symmetries and occlusions, i.e. there can be multiple object poses that are indistinguishable in the given image and should be therefore treated as equivalent. The paper defines 6D object pose estimation problems, proposes an evaluation methodology and introduces three new pose error functions that deal with pose ambiguity. The new error functions are compared with functions commonly used in the literature and shown to remove certain types of non-intuitive outcomes.

    abstract = {We address the problem of inferring the pose of an RGB-D camera relative to a known 3D scene, given only a single acquired image. Our approach employs a regression forest that is capable of inferring an estimate of each pixel’s correspondence to 3D points in the scene’s world coordinate frame. The forest uses only simple depth and RGB pixel comparison features, and does not require the computation of feature descriptors. The forest is trained to be capable of predicting correspondences at any pixel, so no interest point detectors are required. The camera pose is inferred using a robust optimization scheme. This starts with an initial set of hypothesized camera poses, constructed by applying the forest at a small fraction of image pixels. Preemptive RANSAC then iterates sampling more pixels at which to evaluate the forest, counting inliers, and refining the hypothesized poses. We evaluate on several varied scenes captured with an RGB-D camera and observe that the proposed technique achieves highly accurate relocalization and substantially out-performs two state of the art baselines.},

The pose estimation and the color information allow us to check the detection hypotheses and improves the correct detection rate by 13{\%} with respect to the original LINEMOD. These many improvements make our framework suitable for object manipulation in Robotics applications.

Recent developments in microscope design and imaging hardware, paired with enhanced image processing and automation capabilities, are poised to further advance the effectiveness of cryo-EM methods. These developments promise to increase the speed and extent of automation, and to improve the resolutions that may be achieved, making this technology useful to determine a wide variety of biological structures. Additionally, established modalities for structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are being routinely integrated with cryo-EM density maps to achieve atomic-resolution models of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies. In this review, which is directed towards readers who are not experts in cryo-EM methodology, we provide an overview of emerging themes in the application of this technology to investigate diverse questions in biology and medicine. We discuss the ways in which these methods are being used to study structures of macromolecular assemblies that range in size from whole cells to small proteins. Finally, we include a description of how the structural information obtained by cryo-EM is deposited and archived in a publicly accessible database.",
